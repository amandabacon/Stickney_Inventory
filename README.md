# Final for DBMS Fall 2017

This is a web.py spin off using python and psql.

This program, website, and database is geared toward being used by Stickney Observatory as a means of taking inventory and keeping a log of all of the items inputted into the database.

The user can search through the database through the use of a web.py HTML page to find information on logged items.

The user can also fill out a form in order to log some items into the psql database. 

# Installation

In order to use this application, you must first download/install postgresql. Information can be found here: https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.6/static/tutorial-install.html

This model was run and tested on the Linux Ubuntu operating system.

# Next Steps:

Would like to:

-be able to edit on HTML page, and these edits appear in db

-login using Bton credentials

-liken empty strings to null values to return an error to user

-prevent repetition in database
